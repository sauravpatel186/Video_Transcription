# Video Transcription and Search Engine

This project provides a solution for transcribing video content into text and enables search functionality within the transcribed text. It is particularly useful for indexing and searching through video lectures, meetings, or any other video content that requires text-based access.

## Features
- **Video Transcription**: Automatically convert the audio in video files into text using state-of-the-art deep learning models.
- **Search Functionality**: Search through the transcribed text to locate specific segments of the video.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for the project.
- **MoviePy**: For handling video files and extracting audio.
- **Transformers**: Utilized for converting audio to text via pretrained models.
- **PyTorch**: Framework for deep learning and model execution.
- **AWS Services** (if applicable): For storage and processing in the cloud.

## Project Structure
1. **Video Files**: Videos are processed and their contents listed.
2. **Transcription**: Videos are transcribed using machine learning models.
3. **Search Functionality**: A search system is implemented to locate specific segments within the transcribed text.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- AWS account (if using cloud storage)

### Running the Project
1. Place your video files in the specified directory or upload them to AWS S3.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook to transcribe the videos and generate searchable text:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Video_Transcription.ipynb
    ```
3. Once transcription is complete, use the provided search functionality to locate specific content in the video.

## Usage
1. **Viewing Video Files**: List and manage your video files in the chosen storage location.
2. **Transcribing Videos**: Execute the transcription code in the notebook to convert videos into text.
3. **Search**: Utilize the search system to query specific terms or phrases from the transcribed content.
